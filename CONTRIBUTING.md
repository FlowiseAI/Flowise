-   Add new chatflow ideas

### Developers

Flowise has 3 different modules in a single mono repository.

-   `server`: Node backend to serve API logics
-   `ui`: React frontend
-   `components`: Langchain components

#### Prerequisite

-   Install [Yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
    ```bash
    npm i -g yarn
    ```

#### Step by step

1. Fork the official [Flowise Github Repository](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise).

2. Clone your forked repository.

3. Create a new branch, see [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository). Naming conventions:

    - For feature branch: `feature/<Your New Feature>`
    - For bug fix branch: `bugfix/<Your New Bugfix>`.

4. Switch to the newly created branch.

5. Go into repository folder

    ```bash
    cd Flowise
    ```

6. Install all dependencies of all modules:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

7. Build all the code:

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

8. Start the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

9. For development:

    - Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/ui`
    - Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/server`
    - Run

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    Any changes made in `packages/ui` or `packages/server` will be reflected on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

    For changes made in `packages/components`, run `yarn build` again to pickup the changes.

10. After making all the changes, run

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

    and

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    to make sure everything works fine in production.

11. Commit code and submit Pull Request from forked branch pointing to [Flowise master](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/tree/master).

## üå± Env Variables

Flowise support different environment variables to configure your instance. You can specify the following variables in the `.env` file inside `packages/server` folder. Read [more](https://docs.flowiseai.com/environment-variables)
