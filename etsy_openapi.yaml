    Open API provides a simple RESTful interface for various Etsy.com features. The
    API endpoints are meant to replace Etsy's Open API v2, which is scheduled to end
    service in 2022.</p><p class="wt-pb-xs-2">All of the endpoints are callable and
    the majority of the API endpoints are now in a beta phase. This means we do not
    expect to make any breaking changes before our general release. A handful of endpoints
    are currently interface stubs (labeled “Feedback Only”) and returns a "501 Not
    Implemented" response code when called.</p><p class="wt-pb-xs-2">If you'd like
    to report an issue or provide feedback on the API design, <a target="_blank" class="wt-text-link

        Uploads a new file for a digital listing, or associates an existing file with a specific listing. You must either provide the `listing_file_id` of an existing file, or the name and binary file data for a file to upload. Associating an existing file to a physical listing converts the physical listing into a digital listing, which removes all shipping costs and any product and inventory variations.

        Uploads or assigns an image to a listing identified by a shop ID with a listing ID. To upload a new image, set the image file as the value for the `image` parameter. You can assign a previously deleted image to a listing using the deleted image's image ID in the `listing_image_id` parameter. When a request contains both `image` and `listing_image_id` parameter values, the endpoint uploads the image in the `image` parameter only. Note: When uploading a new image, data such as colors and size may return as null values due to asynchronous processing of the image. Use getListingImage endpoint to fetch these values.

The update fails if the supplied values for product sku, offering quantity, and/or price are incompatible with values in `*_on_property_*` fields. When setting a price, assign a float equal to amount divided by divisor as specified in the Money resource.

        Updates a listing, identified by a listing ID, for a specific shop identified by a shop ID. Note that this is a PATCH method type. When activating, or manually renewing a physical listing, the shipping profile referenced by the `shipping_profile_id`, and all of its fields, along with its entries and upgrades must be complete and valid. If the shipping profile is not complete and valid, we will throw an exception with an error message that guides the request sender to update whatever data is bad.

        Submits tracking information for a Shop Receipt, which creates a Shop Receipt Shipment entry for the given receipt_id. Each time you successfully submit tracking info, Etsy sends a notification email to the buyer User. When send_bcc is true, Etsy sends shipping notifications to the seller as well. When tracking_code and carrier_name aren't sent, the receipt is marked as shipped only. If the carrier is not supported, you may use `other` as the carrier name so you can provide the tracking code. **NOTES** When shipping within the United States AND the order is over $10 _or_ when shipping to India, tracking code and carrier name ARE required. Access to ShopReceipt's first_line, second_line, city, state, zip, country_iso and formatted_address is contingent in some regions to a preferred partnership status with Etsy

        Consolidates Return Policies by moving all listings from a source return policy to a destination return policy, and deleting the source return policy. This is commonly used in the event that a user attempts to update a Return Policy such that its data is a duplicate of some other Return Policy, which is prevented.

        Creates a new shipping destination, which sets the shipping cost, carrier, and class for a destination in a [shipping profile](/documentation/reference/#tag/Shop-ShippingProfile). createShopShippingProfileDestination assigns costs using the currency of the associated shop. Set the destination using either `destination_country_iso` or `destination_region`; `destination_country_iso` and `destination_region` are mutually exclusive — set one or the other. Setting both triggers error 400. If the request sets neither `destination_country_iso` nor `destination_region`, the default destination is "everywhere". You must also either assign both a `shipping_carrier_id` AND `mail_class` or both `min_delivery_days` AND `max_delivery_days`.

        Deletes a shipping destination and removes the destination option from every listing that uses the associated shipping profile. A shipping profile requires at least one shipping destination, so this endpoint cannot delete the final shipping destination for any shipping profile. To delete the final shipping destination from a shipping profile, you must [delete the entire shipping profile](/documentation/reference/#operation/deleteShopShippingProfile).
