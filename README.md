## ‚ö°Quick Start

There are two main ways to get started with TheAnswer: local development setup and deployment on Render.

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/the-answerai/theanswer.git
    cd theanswer
    ```

2. Initialize and update git submodules:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --init
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    - Create `.env` files in the following locations:
        - `/packages/server/.env`
        - `/packages/ui/.env`
        - `/apps/web/.env`
        - `/.env` (root directory)

    If `.env.example` files are not available, please reach out to The AnswerAI team for the required environment variables. These files contain sensitive configuration details needed for local development.

    **Note:** For local development, you'll need to be added to the Auth0 development team with appropriate permissions (Member role or above). Please contact The AnswerAI team to get access.

4. Database Setup:

    - Install and open [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
    - Connect to your PostgreSQL instance
    - Create a new database named `flowise`
    - Configure the database connection in your `.env` files

5. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

6. Build the project:

    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

    If you encounter any database or Prisma-related issues:

    - Try rebuilding with force: `pnpm build --force`
    - If issues persist, run migrations: `pnpm db:migrate`
    - Then rebuild again: `pnpm build --force`

7. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

8. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access TheAnswer.

### Deploy on Render (Recommended for Easy Setup)

For a quick and easy setup, we recommend deploying TheAnswer on Render:

1. Click the "Deploy to Render" button below:

    [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/the-answerai/theanswer)

2. Follow the prompts on Render to complete the deployment process.

3. Once deployed, you'll receive a URL to access your TheAnswer instance.

For detailed instructions on both local development and Render deployment, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.theanswer.ai/).

Note: The standalone TheAnswer CLI tool is currently under development. Stay tuned for updates on its release and installation process.

Note: The TheAnswer package is currently under development and not yet published to npm. Stay tuned for updates on when it will be available as a standalone CLI tool.

## üê≥ Docker

### Docker Compose

1. Go to `docker` folder at the root of the project
2. Copy `.env.example` file, paste it into the same location, and rename to `.env`
3. `docker compose up -d`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
5. You can bring the containers down by `docker compose stop`

### Docker Image

1. Build the image locally:
    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache -t flowise .
    ```
2. Run image:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name flowise -p 3000:3000 flowise
    ```

3. Stop image:
    ```bash
    docker stop flowise
    ```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developers

TheAnswer is built on top of Flowise and extends its functionality. The project structure is as follows:

### Packages (from Flowise)

All packages inside `packages/*` are from the original Flowise project:

-   `server`: Node backend to serve API logics
-   `ui`: React frontend for Flowise
-   `components`: Third-party nodes integrations
-   `embed`: Embedding functionality
-   `embed-react`: React components for embedding
-   `flowise-configs`: Configuration files for Flowise

### Packages-Answers (TheAnswer-specific)

TheAnswer adds additional functionality through the `packages-answers/*` directory:

-   `db`: Database interactions
-   `eslint-config-custom`: Custom ESLint configuration
-   `experimental-prisma-webpack-plugin`: Experimental Prisma plugin for Webpack
-   `tsconfig`: TypeScript configuration
-   `types`: Shared type definitions
-   `ui`: TheAnswer-specific UI components
-   `utils`: Utility functions

This structure allows TheAnswer to build upon Flowise's core functionality while adding its own features and customizations. The TheAnswer-specific packages extend and enhance the capabilities of the original Flowise project, providing additional tools for AI-powered productivity and workflow management.

### Prerequisite

-   Install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
    ```bash
    npm i -g pnpm
    ```

### Setup

1.  Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/the-answerai/theanswer.git
    ```

2.  Go into repository folder

    ```bash
    cd theanswer
    ```

3.  Install all dependencies of all modules:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  Build all the code:

    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>Exit code 134 (JavaScript heap out of memory)</summary>  
      If you get this error when running the above `build` script, try increasing the Node.js heap size and run the script again:

        export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
        pnpm build

    </details>

5.  Start the app:

    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

    You can now access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6.  For development build:

    -   Create `.env` file and specify the `VITE_PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/ui`
    -   Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/server`
    -   Run

        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```

    Any code changes will reload the app automatically on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üîí Authentication

To enable app level authentication, add `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` to the `.env` file in `packages/server`:

```
FLOWISE_USERNAME=user
FLOWISE_PASSWORD=1234
```

## üå± Env Variables

TheAnswer supports different environment variables to configure your instance. You can specify the following variables in the `.env` file inside `packages/server` folder. Read [more](https://github.com/the-answerai/theanswer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-env-variables)
