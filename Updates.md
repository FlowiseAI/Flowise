## Overview

This feature adds detailed usage event tracking to the billing page, sourcing data primarily from Langfuse traces with Stripe synchronization status.

## Implementation Status

ðŸŸ¡ In Progress - Basic implementation complete, needs testing

## Changelog

### Core Implementation

-   Added new data models in `packages/server/src/aai-utils/billing/core/types.ts`:

    -   `UsageEvent` interface for representing individual usage events
    -   `UsageEventsResponse` interface for API responses
    -   `GetUsageEventsParams` interface for query parameters

-   Added backend functionality:

    -   Added `getUsageEvents` method to `LangfuseProvider` class
    -   Added `getUsageEvents` method to `BillingService` class
    -   Added controller function in `packages/server/src/controllers/billing/index.ts`
    -   Added API route `/api/billing/usage/events` in `packages/server/src/routes/billing/index.ts`

-   Added frontend functionality:
    -   Added API client method in `packages/ui/src/api/billing.js`
    -   Created custom hook `useUsageEvents` in `packages-answers/ui/src/billing/hooks/useUsageEvents.ts`
    -   Created `UsageEventsTable` component in `packages-answers/ui/src/billing/UsageEventsTable.tsx`
    -   Updated billing page to include the new component

## Implementation Details

### Backend

The backend implementation fetches trace data from Langfuse and transforms it into a format suitable for the frontend. It includes:

-   Pagination support
-   Sorting by timestamp
-   Filtering by customer ID
-   Detailed credit breakdown (AI tokens, compute, storage)
-   Synchronization status with Stripe

### Frontend

The frontend implementation displays usage events in a table with:

-   Sorting capabilities
-   Pagination controls
-   Visual indicators for sync status (using colored chips)
-   Breakdown of credit usage by type
-   Responsive design

## Next Steps

-   Add comprehensive testing
-   Add documentation
-   Cross-browser and responsiveness testing
-   Deploy to staging and production environments
