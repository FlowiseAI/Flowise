# Execution Entity Authentication and User Scoping Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication and user scoping implementation for the executions entity, which ensures proper access control and data isolation for execution records.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Migration Files Added
- `1738091000000-AddUserScopingToExecution.ts` for all database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite)
- Adds `userId` and `organizationId` columns to the `execution` table
- Creates indexes for optimal query performance

#### Entity Updates
- **Execution.ts**: Added `userId` and `organizationId` fields with proper indexing
- **Interface.ts**: Updated `IExecution` interface to include new fields

### 2. Route Protection

#### Routes Updated
- **executions/index.ts**: Added `enforceAbility('Execution')` middleware to all routes
- Ensures all execution endpoints are protected with proper authentication

### 3. Controller Enhancements

#### Authentication Checks
- Added `req.user` validation for all methods
- Implemented ownership verification using `checkOwnership` utility
- Added proper error handling with `InternalFlowiseError`

#### Methods Updated
- `getExecutionById`: Validates user access to specific execution
- `getAllExecutions`: Filters results by user/organization context
- `updateExecution`: Verifies ownership before allowing updates
- `deleteExecutions`: Applies user/organization filtering for deletions

### 4. Service Layer Updates

#### User Scoping Implementation
- **getAllExecutions**: Added `UserFilter` parameter for organization/user filtering
- **getExecutionById**: Added user context validation
- **updateExecution**: Added user scope checking
- **deleteExecutions**: Implements user-scoped deletion

#### Interface Additions
```typescript
interface UserFilter {
    userId?: string
    organizationId: string
}
```

### 5. Execution Creation

#### Updated Creation Process
- **buildAgentflow.ts**: Modified `addExecution` function to include user context
- Executions now automatically inherit `userId` and `organizationId` from the authenticated user
- Ensures all new executions are properly scoped from creation

## Security Features

### Access Control Hierarchy
1. **Admin Users**: Full access to all executions within their organization
2. **Regular Users**: Access only to executions they own within their organization

### Data Isolation
- Organization-level isolation prevents cross-organization data access
- User-level filtering ensures users only see their own executions (unless admin)
- Public executions remain accessible without authentication

### Authentication Flow
1. API Key or JWT authentication via middleware
2. `enforceAbility('Execution')` validates resource access
3. Controllers verify specific execution ownership
4. Services apply user/organization filtering

## API Behavior Changes

### Before Implementation
- All users could access all executions
- No authentication required for execution endpoints
- No user/organization context in execution records

### After Implementation
- Authentication required for all execution operations
- Users can only access executions within their organization
- Regular users see only their own executions
- Admin users see all executions in their organization
- Execution creation automatically includes user context

## Testing Recommendations

### Authentication Testing
1. Test API key authentication with execution endpoints
2. Verify JWT authentication fallback works correctly
3. Test unauthorized access attempts return 401 errors

### Access Control Testing
1. Verify users can only access their own executions
2. Test admin users can access all organization executions
3. Confirm cross-organization access is blocked
4. Test public execution access works without authentication

### Data Integrity Testing
1. Verify new executions include correct user/organization context
2. Test execution updates maintain ownership constraints
3. Confirm deletion operations respect user scoping

## Migration Considerations

### Existing Data
- Existing execution records will have `NULL` values for `userId` and `organizationId`
- These records may need manual data migration if historical user context is available
- Consider setting default organization values for orphaned executions

### Deployment Steps
1. Run database migrations to add new columns
2. Deploy updated application code
3. Verify authentication is working correctly
4. Monitor for any access issues in production
