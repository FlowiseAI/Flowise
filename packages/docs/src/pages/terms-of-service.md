(vii) your electronic or physical signature.  
The Company will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the addresses set forth in the "Notice" section of this Agreement.  
It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. The Company may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and the Company may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.  
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.  
We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification. Without limiting the Company's other rights, the Company may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer's access to the Services, Website, and/or any other website owned or operated by the Company.  
**_Counter-Notification._** If access on the Website to a work that you submitted to the Company is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above. Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:  
(i) a legend or subject line that says: "DMCA Counter-Notification";  
(ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL of the Website from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);  
(iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;  
(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your account;  
(v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and  
(vi) your electronic or physical signature.  
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.  
If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification. However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service. You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

**_Choice of Law._** These Terms of Service and the relationship between you and the Company shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  
**_Dispute Resolution._**

-   **_Informal Dispute Resolution_**. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against the Company, you agree to make a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute informally before taking formal legal action against the Company. Notice of such claims or disputes should be submitted via email to info@theanswer.ai. Upon receipt of notice of such claim or dispute, Company agrees to engage in informal dispute resolutions within 15 days of its receipt of written notice of the claim or dispute. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you may bring a formal proceeding.
-   **_We Both Agree To Arbitrate_**. You and the Company agree to resolve any disputes through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis, except as set forth under "Exceptions to Agreement" to Arbitrate below.

-   **_Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate_**. Either you or the Company may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Company's products or the Company Service, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
-   **_No Class Actions_**. You may only resolve Disputes with the Company on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed under this Agreement.
-   **_Judicial Forum for Disputes_**. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and the Company agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California. Both you and the Company consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.
