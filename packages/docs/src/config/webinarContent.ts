        {
            question: "This sounds too complex to implement. How do we know it won't be another 18-month project?",
            answer: "IAS (Integral Ad Science) deployed our full solution in exactly 4 weeks with all employees onboarded. We've proven this timeline works because we pre-built 100+ integrations (SFDC, Jira, Confluence, etc.) and use a human-in-the-loop approach rather than trying to automate everything at once."
        },
        {
            question: "What about vendor lock-in? We've been burned before by platforms that held our data hostage.",
            answer: 'Unlike competitors, you bring your own API tokens and can switch between OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini instantly. Complete export capabilities mean you keep everything if you cancel. Open-source components let you fork and modify code. Your data, your infrastructure, your control.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How do we handle security and compliance in a regulated industry?',

        },
        {
            question: "What's the actual ROI? We need concrete numbers to justify this to our board.",
            answer: 'Palatine Capital Partners saved $312K annually by automating 120 analyst-hours per week. Average clients see 10-30% reduction in SaaS tool spending within 90 days. IAS achieved 40% faster ticket resolution. Typical payback period is 90 days with measurable productivity gains.'
        },
        {
            question: "Our team isn't technical. Will we need to hire AI specialists to use this?",
            answer: "Monostruck Medical's sales operations team (non-technical) unified 9 reps across locations in 3 weeks. Our 'buttons beat chat' philosophy means simple interfaces, not complex AI interactions. We provide training, but the platform is designed for business users, not developers."
