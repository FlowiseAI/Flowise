## 3.1. Finding Information, Fast!

Forget digging through endless folders or old email chains. If your AnswerAgent Sidekicks are connected to your company's documents (using features like Document Stores), they can become your own super-powered search engine.

-   **Use Case:** You need to know the company's official policy on remote work, or the specific features of a new product your team just launched.
-   **Example Prompt:** "What is our company policy on international remote work?" or "Can you list the top 5 features of the 'Phoenix_Suite' software and who the target audience is?"
-   **AnswerAgent Angle:** "Why spend minutes searching when your Sidekick can find it in seconds? Just ask!"

Overwhelmed by long articles, reports, or meeting transcripts? Your AnswerAgent Sidekick can be a lifesaver.
