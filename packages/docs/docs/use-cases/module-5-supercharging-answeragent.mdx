# Module 5: Supercharging Your AnswerAgent Experience

You've learned the AI basics, mastered the art of prompting, and seen what AnswerAgent can do. Now, let's look at a few features and tips to truly supercharge your experience and make AnswerAgent your indispensable AI companion.

## 5.1. Meet Your Sidekicks!

One of the most powerful aspects of AnswerAgent is the concept of **Sidekicks**.

-   **What are they?** Think of Sidekicks as specialized chatbots or AI assistants that have been designed and configured for specific tasks or to work with particular sets of information. Your organization might have a Sidekick for HR questions, another for IT support, one for sales data analysis, and yet another for helping draft marketing content.
-   **How do you use them?** In the AnswerAgent chat interface, you'll often be able to select which Sidekick you want to interact with. Choosing the right Sidekick for your task means you're talking to an AI that's already primed with the right knowledge, tools, and instructions.
-   **Why are they super?** Instead of a one-size-fits-all AI, you get a team of specialists!

**Simplicity Tip:** It's like having a speed-dial for different experts. Need help with a customer query? Call the "Customer Support Pro" Sidekick. Need market research data? Dial up the "Market Analyst" Sidekick.

_(For those who build them: Sidekicks are created in the [Sidekick Studio](/docs/sidekick-studio). But for users, it's all about selecting the right one for the job!)_

## 5.2. Using the AnswerAgent Chat Interface Effectively

Your main interaction point will often be the AnswerAgent chat window. Here are a few general tips:

-   **Be Clear and Concise:** Even with a specialized Sidekick, clear prompts (as we learned in Module 2!) are key.
-   **Check for Context:** If a Sidekick seems to have forgotten what you were talking about, gently remind it or rephrase your question with more context.
-   **Use Threads (if available):** Some chat interfaces organize conversations into threads. This helps keep different topics separate and makes it easier to refer back to previous points.
-   **Explore Features:** Look out for buttons or options like file uploads, regenerating responses, or providing feedback â€“ these can enhance your interaction.

_(You can find more details about the general chat interface and selecting Sidekicks in our [Chat documentation](/docs/chat).)_

## 5.3. Power-Up with the Browser Extension

If your organization uses the AnswerAgent Browser Extension, you're in for a treat! This handy tool can bring AI assistance directly into your web browsing.

-   **What can it do?** (This depends on how it's configured, but common uses include:)

    -   **Summarize Webpages:** Instantly get the gist of long articles or web content without reading every word.
    -   **Contextual Chat:** Chat with a Sidekick about the content of the page you're currently viewing.
    -   **Quick Actions:** Perform tasks related to the webpage, like drafting an email based on its content or saving information.

-   **How to Use It:** Typically, you'll click the AnswerAgent icon in your browser's toolbar to activate its features on the current page.

**AnswerAgent Angle:** The [Browser Extension](/docs/browser) is like having a smart co-pilot for your web surfing, always ready to help you understand and interact with online content more efficiently.

## 5.4. AI for Good: Using AnswerAgent Responsibly

As you use AnswerAgent and other AI tools, it's great to keep a few responsible practices in mind:

-   **Data Privacy:** Be mindful of the information you share with AI, especially if it's sensitive or confidential. Understand your organization's policies on using AI with different types of data.
-   **Verify Critical Information:** AI is smart, but not infallible. If an AI gives you information that you'll use for important decisions, try to verify it from a trusted source if possible.
-   **Be Aware of Bias:** AI models learn from vast amounts of data, which can sometimes reflect human biases. If a response seems biased or unfair, question it and consider providing feedback if that option is available.
-   **Give Constructive Feedback:** Many AI systems have feedback mechanisms (like thumbs up/down). Using these helps improve the AI for everyone.
-   **Understand Limitations:** Remember what AI _can't_ do (from Module 1). This helps you use it for what it's best at.

**Simplicity Tip:** Use AI as a powerful tool to assist you, but always keep your critical thinking cap on!
