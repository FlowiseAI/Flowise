# DynamoDB Chat Memory

## Overview

The DynamoDB Chat Memory feature allows you to store and retrieve conversation history using Amazon DynamoDB. This powerful integration enables long-term persistence of chat messages, making it ideal for applications that require durable and scalable conversation storage.

## Key Benefits

-   **Persistent Storage**: Safely store conversation history in a reliable and scalable AWS service.
-   **Seamless Integration**: Easily incorporate long-term memory into your AnswerAI workflows.
-   **Flexible Configuration**: Customize settings to match your specific DynamoDB setup and requirements.

## How to Use

1. Add the "DynamoDB Chat Memory" node to your AnswerAI canvas.
2. Configure the node with the following required parameters:

    - Table Name: The name of your DynamoDB table
    - Partition Key: The primary key for your table
    - Region: The AWS region where your table is located (e.g., "us-east-1")

3. (Optional) Set additional parameters:

    - Session ID: A unique identifier for the conversation (if not specified, a random ID will be generated)
    - Memory Key: The key used to store the chat history (default is "chat_history")

4. Connect your AWS credentials:

    - Click on the "Connect Credential" option
    - Select or create a credential of type "dynamodbMemoryApi"
    - Provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

5. Connect the DynamoDB Chat Memory node to other nodes in your workflow that require access to conversation history.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. Ensure your DynamoDB table is set up with the correct partition key before using this feature.
2. Use a consistent session ID across interactions to maintain continuity in long-running conversations.
3. Implement proper security measures to protect your AWS credentials and access to the DynamoDB table.
4. Monitor your DynamoDB usage to optimize cost and performance.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**:

    - Verify that your AWS credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions to access the DynamoDB table.
    - Check if the specified AWS region matches the location of your DynamoDB table.

2. **Data Not Persisting**:

    - Ensure the table name and partition key are correctly specified.
    - Verify that the session ID is consistent across interactions if you're trying to retrieve previous conversation history.

3. **Performance Concerns**:
    - If you experience slow response times, consider optimizing your DynamoDB table's read and write capacity units.
