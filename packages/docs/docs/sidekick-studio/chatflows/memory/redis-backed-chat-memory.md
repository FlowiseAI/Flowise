# Redis-Backed Chat Memory

## Overview

The Redis-Backed Chat Memory is a powerful feature in AnswerAI that allows you to store and retrieve conversation history using a Redis server. This memory node summarizes conversations and provides long-term storage, enabling more context-aware and personalized interactions in your AI applications.

## Key Benefits

-   **Persistent Memory**: Store conversation history securely in a Redis server for long-term retention.
-   **Scalable**: Efficiently handle large volumes of conversation data across multiple sessions.
-   **Customizable**: Configure session timeouts, memory keys, and window sizes to suit your specific needs.

## How to Use

1. Add the Redis-Backed Chat Memory node to your AnswerAI workflow canvas.
2. Configure the node settings:
    - Connect your Redis credential (optional)
    - Set a Session ID (optional)
    - Configure Session Timeouts (optional)
    - Specify a Memory Key
    - Set the Window Size (optional)
3. Connect the memory node to other nodes in your workflow that require conversation history.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Session Management**: Use unique session IDs for different conversations or users to keep memories separate.
2. **Memory Key**: Choose a descriptive memory key to easily identify the purpose of the stored data.
3. **Window Size**: Adjust the window size to balance between providing sufficient context and managing memory usage.
4. **Security**: Ensure your Redis server is properly secured, especially when storing sensitive conversation data.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**:

    - Verify that your Redis server is running and accessible.
    - Double-check the connection credentials in the AnswerAI settings.

2. **Memory Not Persisting**:

    - Ensure that the Session ID is correctly set and consistent across interactions.
    - Check if the Session Timeout is set appropriately for your use case.

3. **Performance Concerns**:
    - If you experience slow responses, try reducing the Window Size to limit the amount of history being processed.

## Configuration Options

### Session ID

-   **Description**: A unique identifier for the conversation session.
-   **Default**: If not specified, a random ID will be generated.
-   **Usage**: Use consistent session IDs to maintain conversation continuity across interactions.

### Session Timeouts

-   **Description**: The duration (in seconds) after which a session expires.
-   **Default**: Omit this parameter to make sessions never expire.
-   **Usage**: Set an appropriate timeout to manage server resources and clear old conversations.

### Memory Key

-   **Description**: A key used to identify and retrieve the stored chat history.
-   **Default**: 'chat_history'
-   **Usage**: Use descriptive keys to organize different types of conversation data.

### Window Size

-   **Description**: The number of recent messages to include in the conversation history.
-   **Default**: Not set (includes all messages)
-   **Usage**: Adjust this value to balance between context depth and processing efficiency.
