# Buffer Window Memory

## Overview

The Buffer Window Memory node is a memory component in AnswerAI that stores and retrieves a fixed number of recent conversation turns. It uses a window of size k to surface the last k back-and-forth exchanges to use as memory for the AI model.

## Key Benefits

-   Maintains context by keeping recent conversation history
-   Customizable memory size to balance between context and efficiency
-   Improves the coherence and relevance of AI responses

## How to Use

1. Add the Buffer Window Memory node to your AnswerAI workflow canvas.
2. Configure the node settings:
    - Set the "Size" parameter to determine how many conversation turns to remember (default is 4).
    - Optionally, specify a "Session ID" for managing multiple conversations.
    - Customize the "Memory Key" if needed (default is "chat_history").
3. Connect the Buffer Window Memory node to other nodes in your workflow that require conversation history.

## Tips and Best Practices

-   Choose an appropriate window size:
    -   Larger sizes provide more context but may slow down processing.
    -   Smaller sizes are more efficient but may miss important earlier context.
-   Use unique session IDs for different conversations to keep memories separate.
-   The memory automatically stores both user inputs and AI responses.

## Troubleshooting

-   If the AI seems to be forgetting important information:
    -   Increase the window size to retain more conversation history.
    -   Check if the correct session ID is being used.
-   If the workflow is running slowly:
    -   Try reducing the window size to improve performance.
    -   Ensure you're not storing unnecessary information in the memory.

## Advanced Usage

The Buffer Window Memory node in AnswerAI is built on top of Langchain's BufferWindowMemory class and includes additional functionality for database integration. Here are some advanced features:

-   Database Integration: The node can store and retrieve conversation history from a database, allowing for persistent memory across sessions.
-   Flexible Retrieval: You can retrieve chat messages as either simple message objects or as BaseMessage instances for more advanced processing.
-   Prepend Messages: The node allows you to prepend additional messages to the retrieved history, useful for adding context or system messages.

Remember that while this node provides powerful memory capabilities, it's important to use it responsibly and in compliance with data privacy regulations, especially when storing user conversations.
