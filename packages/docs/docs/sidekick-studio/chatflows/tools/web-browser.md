-   Enables agents to access and process information from the web
-   Enhances the capabilities of your workflows by incorporating real-time web data
-   Allows for dynamic information gathering based on user queries or workflow requirements

## How to Use

1. Locate the Web Browser tool in the Tools section of the node palette.
2. Drag and drop the Web Browser node onto your canvas.
3. Connect the necessary inputs to the Web Browser node:
    - Language Model: Connect a language model node to enable text processing.
    - Embeddings: Connect an embeddings node for text representation.
4. Configure any additional settings if required (refer to the node's settings panel).
5. Connect the Web Browser node's output to subsequent nodes in your workflow.

-   Use the Web Browser tool in combination with other nodes to filter, process, or analyze the retrieved web content.

## Troubleshooting

-   If the Web Browser tool fails to retrieve content, check your internet connection and verify that the target website is accessible.
-   Ensure that your language model and embeddings are correctly configured and compatible with the Web Browser tool.
-   If you encounter performance issues, consider optimizing your workflow to minimize unnecessary web requests.
