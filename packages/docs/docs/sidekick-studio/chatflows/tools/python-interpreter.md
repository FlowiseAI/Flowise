# Python Interpreter

## Overview

The Python Interpreter tool in AnswerAI allows you to execute Python code within a secure sandbox environment. This powerful feature enables you to run Python scripts directly within your workflows, expanding the capabilities of your AI agents.

## Key Benefits

-   Execute Python code safely within AnswerAI workflows
-   Access a wide range of Python libraries and functions
-   Integrate complex computations and data processing into your AI agents

## How to Use

1. Add the Python Interpreter node to your canvas in the AnswerAI Studio.
2. Configure the tool settings:
    - Tool Name: Enter a custom name for the tool (default: "python_interpreter")
    - Tool Description: Provide a description of the tool's functionality (a default description is provided)
3. Connect the Python Interpreter node to other nodes in your workflow as needed.
4. In nodes or agents that use this tool, provide Python code as input when calling the tool.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. Always print your outputs in the Python code, as the environment resets after each execution.
2. Use only packages available in Pyodide, the Python distribution used by this tool.
3. Write clear, self-contained scripts that can be executed independently.
4. Handle potential errors in your Python code to provide informative feedback.

## Troubleshooting

1. **ImportError**: If you encounter an ImportError, make sure you're only using packages available in Pyodide.
2. **Execution Timeout**: For long-running scripts, consider breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts.
3. **Unexpected Results**: Remember that the environment resets after each execution. Store necessary data or state within your script.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the Python Interpreter tool:

```python
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2

radius = 5
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)
print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}")
```

This script will calculate and print the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units.

Remember, the Python Interpreter tool is a powerful feature that allows you to extend the capabilities of your AnswerAI workflows with custom Python code. Use it wisely to enhance your AI agents' functionality and problem-solving abilities.
