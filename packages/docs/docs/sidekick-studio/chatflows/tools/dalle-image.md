4. Remember that image generation may take a few seconds, so account for this in your workflow timing.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Error: "Invalid API key"**

    - Ensure that you have correctly entered your OpenAI API key in the credential settings.
    - Verify that your OpenAI account has access to the Dall-E API.

2. **Image generation fails or returns an error**

    - Check your prompt for any prohibited content or violations of OpenAI's usage policies.
    - Ensure you have sufficient API credits in your OpenAI account.

3. **Unexpected or low-quality image results**
    - Try refining your prompt with more specific details or adjusting the language.
    - Experiment with different model versions if available.

Remember that the quality and relevance of the generated images depend largely on the clarity and specificity of your prompts. Practice and experimentation will help you get the best results from the Dall-E Post Tool in your AnswerAI workflows.
