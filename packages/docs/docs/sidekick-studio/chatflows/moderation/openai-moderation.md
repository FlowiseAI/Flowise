3. Consider adding additional nodes after the OpenAI Moderation node to handle flagged content appropriately (e.g., logging, notifying administrators, or providing alternative responses).
4. Regularly review OpenAI's content policies to stay up-to-date with any changes that may affect your moderation settings.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Issue**: The OpenAI Moderation node is not working.
   **Solution**: Ensure that you have provided a valid OpenAI API key in the credential settings.

2. **Issue**: Content is being flagged incorrectly.
   **Solution**: Review OpenAI's content policies and adjust your input content accordingly. If you believe there's an error in the moderation, you can report it to OpenAI for review.

3. **Issue**: The custom error message is not displaying.
   **Solution**: Make sure you have entered the custom message correctly in the "Error Message" field and that there are no formatting issues.

By using the OpenAI Moderation node in your AnswerAI workflows, you can ensure that your AI-generated content remains compliant with OpenAI's usage policies, promoting responsible and ethical AI practices.
