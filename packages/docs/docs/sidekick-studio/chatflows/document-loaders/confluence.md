## Tips and Best Practices

1. Use the Space Key carefully: Make sure you have the correct Space Key to import the desired documents. You can find the Space Key by following the [official Atlassian guide](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/How-to-find-the-key-for-a-space/qaq-p/864760).

2. Optimize performance: If you're working with a large Confluence space, consider using the "Limit" option to import a smaller subset of documents initially.

3. Customize metadata: Use the "Additional Metadata" option to add relevant information to your imported documents, making them easier to organize and search within AnswerAI.

4. Text splitting: If you're working with large Confluence pages, use a Text Splitter to break them into smaller, more manageable chunks for processing.

## Troubleshooting

1. Connection issues:

    - Ensure your Confluence API credentials are correct and up-to-date.
    - Check that your Base URL is accurate and includes the full path to your Confluence instance.

2. No documents imported:

    - Verify that the Space Key is correct and that you have permission to access the specified space.
    - Check if there are any documents in the selected space.

3. Metadata problems:
    - If you're not seeing expected metadata, make sure you haven't accidentally omitted important keys using the "Omit Metadata Keys" option.
    - When adding custom metadata, ensure your JSON format is correct in the "Additional Metadata" field.

By following this guide, you'll be able to efficiently import and process your Confluence documents within AnswerAI, enhancing your workflows with valuable information from your existing knowledge base.
