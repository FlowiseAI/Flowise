    c. Single Column Extraction (optional): Specify a column name if you want to extract data from a single column.

3. Connect the CSV File Document Loader to other nodes in your AnswerAI workflow.

4. Run your workflow to process the CSV data.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. When working with large CSV files, consider using a Text Splitter to break down the content into manageable chunks.

2. If you only need data from a specific column, use the Single Column Extraction option to streamline your workflow.

3. Utilize the Additional Metadata option to add context or categorization to your documents.

4. Use the Omit Metadata Keys feature to remove any sensitive or unnecessary information from the output.

## Troubleshooting

1. File format issues:

    - Ensure your file has a .csv extension.
    - Check that the file is properly formatted with comma-separated values.

2. Column name errors:

    - If using Single Column Extraction, verify that the specified column name exactly matches the header in your CSV file.

3. Metadata parsing problems:

    - When adding Additional Metadata, make sure it's in valid JSON format.

4. Performance concerns:
    - For very large CSV files, consider splitting them into smaller files or using a Text Splitter to improve processing speed.

## Output Options

The CSV File Document Loader offers two output options:

1. Document: Returns an array of document objects containing metadata and page content.
2. Text: Provides a concatenated string of the page content from all documents.

Choose the output that best fits your workflow needs.
