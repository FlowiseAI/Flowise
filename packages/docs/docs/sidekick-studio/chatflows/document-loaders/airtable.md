## Tips and Best Practices

1. Use field IDs instead of names if your field names contain commas.
2. Start with a small dataset to test your configuration before importing large tables.
3. Utilize the "Include Only Fields" option to focus on relevant data and improve performance.
4. Consider using a Text Splitter for large text fields to optimize processing.
5. Add custom metadata to enrich your imported documents for better context in AI tasks.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Authentication Error**: Ensure your Airtable API key is correctly added to AnswerAI credentials.
2. **"Base ID or Table ID not found"**: Double-check the IDs in your Airtable URL and ensure they're correctly entered.
3. **No data imported**: Verify that the specified view and fields exist in your Airtable.
4. **Rate limiting**: If you're importing large datasets, you may hit Airtable's rate limits. Try reducing the batch size or adding delays between requests.

If you encounter persistent issues, check the AnswerAI logs for more detailed error messages or contact support for assistance.

Remember, the Airtable Document Loader is a powerful tool to bridge your Airtable data with AnswerAI's capabilities. Experiment with different configurations to find the best setup for your specific use case.
