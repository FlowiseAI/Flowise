2. For slow processing times:

    - Try using the "Fast" strategy for quicker results
    - Consider breaking large documents into smaller chunks before processing

3. If extracted text is incomplete or inaccurate:
    - Experiment with different processing strategies
    - Adjust the OCR languages if working with non-English documents
    - Use the "Hi-Res" strategy for better accuracy, especially with complex layouts
