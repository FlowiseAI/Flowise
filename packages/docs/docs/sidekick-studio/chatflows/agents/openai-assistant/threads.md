# Threads

[Threads](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works/managing-threads-and-messages) is only used when an OpenAI Assistant is being used. It is a conversation session between an Assistant and a user. Threads store messages and automatically handle truncation to fit content into a modelâ€™s context.

## Separate conversations for multiple users

### UI & Embedded Chat

By default, UI and Embedded Chat will automatically separate threads for multiple users conversations. This is done by generating a unique **`chatId`** for each new interaction. That logic is handled under the hood by Flowise.

### Prediction API

POST /`api/v1/prediction/{your-chatflowid}`, specify the **`chatId`** . Same thread will be used for the same chatId.

```json
{
    "question": "hello!",
    "chatId": "user1"
}
```

### Message API

-   GET `/api/v1/chatmessage/{your-chatflowid}`
-   DELETE `/api/v1/chatmessage/{your-chatflowid}`

You can also filter via **`chatId` -** `/api/v1/chatmessage/{your-chatflowid}?chatId={your-chatid}`

All conversations can be visualized and managed from UI as well:
