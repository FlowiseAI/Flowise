# Reciprocal Rank Fusion Retriever

## Overview

The Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) Retriever is an advanced retrieval method that enhances search results by generating multiple queries and re-ranking the results. This feature improves the relevance and diversity of retrieved documents, especially for complex or ambiguous queries.

## Key Benefits

-   Improved search accuracy by considering multiple query variations
-   Enhanced result diversity through re-ranking of documents
-   Better handling of complex or ambiguous user queries

## How to Use

1. Add the "Reciprocal Rank Fusion Retriever" node to your AnswerAI workflow canvas.

2. Connect the required inputs:

    - Vector Store Retriever: Connect a vector store retriever node.
    - Language Model: Connect a language model node (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4).

3. Configure the node parameters:

    - Query (optional): Specify a custom query or leave blank to use the user's question.
    - Query Count: Set the number of synthetic queries to generate (default is 4).
    - Top K: Specify the number of top results to fetch (default is the base retriever's Top K).
    - Constant: Set the constant value for the RRF algorithm (default is 60).

4. Connect the output to subsequent nodes in your workflow.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. Experiment with different Query Count values to find the optimal balance between result quality and processing time.

2. Adjust the Top K value based on your specific use case. A higher value may provide more comprehensive results but might increase processing time.

3. Fine-tune the Constant value to control the balance between high-ranked and lower-ranked items in the results.

4. Use this retriever for queries that might benefit from multiple perspectives or interpretations.

## Troubleshooting

1. If results seem less relevant than expected:

    - Increase the Query Count to generate more variations of the original query.
    - Adjust the Top K value to retrieve more initial results before re-ranking.

2. If processing time is too long:

    - Reduce the Query Count or Top K values.
    - Ensure your vector store and language model are optimized for performance.

3. If you receive an error about missing inputs:
    - Double-check that both the Vector Store Retriever and Language Model inputs are properly connected.
