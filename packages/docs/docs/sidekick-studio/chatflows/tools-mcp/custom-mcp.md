# Custom MCP for Answer Agent

This documentation outlines how to create and use custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations with Answer Agent. Custom MCPs allow you to build connections to proprietary systems, internal tools, or any API not covered by the built-in MCPs.

## What is a Custom MCP?

A Custom MCP is a server that implements the Model Context Protocol standard, exposing tools that Answer Agent can use to interact with your target system. By creating a custom MCP, you can:

1. **Connect to internal systems** that aren't accessible through public APIs
2. **Add functionality** not available in the standard MCPs
3. **Customize interactions** specific to your organization's needs
4. **Integrate with legacy systems** using your own abstraction layer

## Creating a Custom MCP

To create a custom MCP, you'll need to:

1. **Implement the MCP server protocol** - Either from scratch or by extending an existing MCP server
2. **Define your tools** - The operations your MCP will expose to Answer Agent
3. **Handle authentication** - Secure your integration with appropriate authentication
4. **Deploy your server** - Make it accessible to Answer Agent

### MCP Server Implementation

The MCP protocol defines a standard way for AI assistants to discover and call tools. Your server needs to implement:

-   Tool listing: Providing metadata about available tools
-   Tool calling: Executing operations based on parameters
-   Error handling: Providing meaningful errors for debugging

### Example Implementation

_Detailed implementation examples and code snippets are coming soon._

## Configuring Custom MCP

To connect your Custom MCP to Answer Agent, you'll need:

1. **Server URL or Path**: The location where your MCP server is running
2. **Authentication Details**: Any credentials needed to access your MCP

## Available Tools

The tools available in your Custom MCP depend entirely on your implementation. Common patterns include:

-   **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete for your system's resources
-   **Search Functionality**: Finding resources based on criteria
-   **Process Triggering**: Starting workflows or processes in your system
-   **Data Transformation**: Converting data between formats

## Best Practices

1. **Security First**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
2. **Clear Documentation**: Document your tools for easier use
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages
4. **Rate Limiting**: Protect your systems from overload
5. **Logging**: Track usage for debugging and improvement
