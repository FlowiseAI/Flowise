# Output Parser Nodes

## Overview

Output Parser nodes in AnswerAI are powerful tools designed to transform and structure the raw output from AI models into more useful formats for downstream tasks. These nodes are essential when working with Language Models (LLMs) or chat models to generate structured data or normalize their outputs.

## Key Benefits

-   Standardize and structure AI-generated content
-   Improve data consistency for downstream processing
-   Enhance the usability of AI outputs in various applications
