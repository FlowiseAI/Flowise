# Chatflows

## Overview

Chatflows are the core building blocks of AnswerAgentAI that allow you to create intelligent, interactive AI experiences. They represent configurable workflows that connect various nodes - from AI models to tools and data sources - creating complete solutions that can be deployed across multiple platforms.

## Key Features

1. **Visual Construction**: Build complex AI workflows using a visual canvas without writing code
2. **Modular Design**: Combine and reconfigure nodes to create custom solutions
3. **Multi-Platform Deployment**: Deploy your chatflows across various channels:
    - Embedded chatbots on websites
    - In-app chat interfaces
    - Browser extensions
    - API endpoints
4. **Model Flexibility**: Easily swap between different AI models to find the optimal solution
5. **Tool Integration**: Connect to external tools and data sources to enhance capabilities
6. **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain multiple versions of your chatflows

## Use Cases

### Embedded Chatbots

Deploy chatflows as interactive chatbots directly on your website or application. These chatbots can:

-   Answer customer questions using your knowledge base
-   Guide users through processes
-   Collect information through conversational interfaces
-   Provide 24/7 support without human intervention

### In-App Chat Interface

Integrate chatflows within the AnswerAgentAI interface for internal teams to:

-   Test and iterate on AI workflows
-   Access powerful AI assistants
-   Query company knowledge bases
-   Automate repetitive tasks

### Browser Extension

Extend the functionality of your chatflows to web browsers, allowing users to:

-   Access your AI assistant from any webpage
-   Analyze content on current pages
-   Perform actions without leaving their browsing context

### API Endpoints

Expose chatflows as API endpoints to:

-   Integrate AI capabilities into existing applications
-   Build custom user interfaces
-   Enable programmatic access to AI workflows
-   Scale your AI infrastructure

## Building Effective Chatflows

The power of chatflows comes from their flexibility and modularity. By combining different node types, you can create sophisticated AI experiences:

-   **Chat Models**: Define the AI engine powering your conversations
-   **Document Loaders**: Import knowledge from various sources
-   **Vector Stores**: Enable semantic search and retrieval
-   **Tools**: Connect to external services and APIs
-   **Memory**: Maintain context across conversation turns
-   **Prompts**: Control how the AI responds in different scenarios

The ability to easily swap components means you can continuously improve your chatflows by incorporating the latest AI models and tools as they become available.
