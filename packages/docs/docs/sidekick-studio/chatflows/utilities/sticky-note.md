## Tips and Best Practices

-   Use different colors for Sticky Notes to categorize or prioritize information.

-   Use Sticky Notes to explain complex parts of your workflow or to highlight important considerations.
-   Regularly review and update your Sticky Notes to keep information current.

## Troubleshooting

-   If your Sticky Note text is not visible, ensure that you have entered text in the note field and that the node is large enough to display the content.
-   If you're having trouble moving or resizing the Sticky Note, make sure you're not in a locked or read-only view of the workflow.

Remember, Sticky Notes are visual aids and do not affect the functionality of your workflow. They are purely for documentation and organization purposes.
